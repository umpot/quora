Hi everyone,

Thanks for upvoting a previous post and sorry for making a little mess up.
Would also like to appologize my team mate cause I did not consult publication of magics with him.
 So that's all for the introduction.

The goal of writing this post is to share two innteresting ideas - at least in my opinion
and as We decided to quit from active participation in this contest and
 we would probably not have a time for implementing them,
  and also in my opinion it would be waste if anyone did not check it.
  So let's get to the point. Imagine that graph mentioned in my previous post
   is weighted ( e.g. weights are for example common word matches between the nodes) -
    so let's normalize row-wise the transition matrix of the graph ((i,j) element is weight of edge (i,j)).
     So the first ( much much simplier idea ) would be to normalize this matrix to stochastic matrix ( weights of each row would sum up to 1. )
     and use the wieghts of normalized matrix instead of previous one as feature.
     And the second, much much harder and much much crazier -
     compute the PageRank value for each node and use as feature.
     Happy coding if anyone would catch this and may the force be with You!
